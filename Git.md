# Git Habits

## 1: What is Git?
Git is a version control software. 

### 1.1: What is version control?
When you make PowerPoint slides for a school presentation, you will update them multiple times. Sometimes you make changes but don't like them, so you revert (恢復) the changes and go back to a previous version. It's the same when you code.

When coding, you constantly update your code, creating multiple versions, and sometimes you might want to revert to a previous version. Git is software that helps you track code changes to "control versions." You can revert (上一步), commit (存擋), merge (兩個版本合併), etc., using Git. 

> **Note**: Translation here is just a simple explanation. It should not be taken literally.

### 1.2: What is GitHub?
GitHub is a platform (or we can say a website) that uses the Git software to host code repositories (倉庫). GitHub uses Git to host its users' code.

#### 3.1.1: Make sure you have Git on your local machine.
What is the local machine that I should set up Git on? 

The local machine is the one where you do your coding, because you will use Git to push code to GitHub (or elsewhere). "To push code to GitHub" means "to push code that you wrote on your local machine to GitHub."

- If you SSH into a server and code on the server, set up Git on the server.
- If you code on your laptop, set up Git on your laptop.
